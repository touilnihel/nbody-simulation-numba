# nbody-simulation-numba
This project simulates the gravitational interaction of multiple particles (e.g., planets, stars) using Newtonian gravity. The simulation is optimized using Numba CUDA, enabling parallel computation on a GPU for significant performance improvements over traditional CPU-based methods.
